# 14.04 2020 

*ive spent the past couple days studying python in general in hopes of solving this but i still cannot figure it out, i have heaps of problems that i dont know how to solve like loading sprites, collison and screen movement*

*maybe i went to big*


# 8.05.2020

### 4:00PM - 8:00pm

*after updating the ground using a technique i saw on the pyxel github page i worked on making sloped ground however this doesnt look right and after fiddling with it for a bit i changed it into a brisge which the main character would start from.*

# 13.05.2020

### 6:00PM - 8:20PM

*im have been spending all day thinking about how i am going to make this work but i cnat think of anything*

# 14.05.2020

### 7:30PM - 8:30PM

# 18.05.2020

### All Day

*i spent today just messinga round in a testing file but with no luck*


# 19.05.2020
### 4:30pm -7pm
*Today i just finished class and started on working on my Game I have already completed alot of pixel art so i should be ok to implement it however without the knowledge its impossible*

*My goal for today is to start by creating a black rectangle and program movement this should only take about two hours*

### 8pm - 11pm
*it took three hours to complete that but i also programmed a system where if you touch one side of the screen you get teleported to the oposite side of the other side of the screen like some versions of snake*



*this is starting to remind me of Adventure(1979) and i think i might just recreate that game but fix a couple problems i see with the game*


# 20/05/2020

### 4:30pm - 9:50pm:

Estimated time: 2 hours
Actual time: 4 hours

*I started working on the collison of the main player character and the map,  I was thinking of having a collsion box around the walls but i both didnt know how to do this because i couldnt find a way to have an invisable box and it would take alot more lines of code*

*I chose to have the a colour collison it isnt that great but it will work for what i want to do if i have time i will improve it, i did this by having three layers. The first layer was the player character which was black(0), the second layer is the Map which is so far only yellow(10) and the third layer checks the colour of the coridnates of the player this will tell me if it collides with the wall*

*the problems this causes is*

1.If you press multiple direction buttons it goes the wrong way and you can clip through the wall

2.you have to use strict colours e.g cant use black for walls

*i will fix these problems later on if i have time*


# 22/05/2020

### 8:30PM - 9PM

# 26/05/2020

4:30pm - 2am:

Estimated time: 2 hours
Actual time: 7 hours

*I started working the map by having it so that when you go up to the top of the screen it changes to the next map screen *

*I did this by having the system that makes so if you go to the top of the map you appear at the bottom and adding a new variables. MapX and MapY help pinpoint the section of the map*

*However i am having a problems with this and it isnt switching over and i still do not know why*

# 27/05/2020

### 30mins


*I only spent 30minutes on it because i want to work on it a little bit at least everyday*

# 28/05/2020

### 7:30pm - 1:20am:

Estimated time:7 hours
Actual time: 5 hours

*I started taking today in optimiseing the code and moving the Main menu to its own file*

*However doing this i fixed the Map problem, the reason this didnt work is because it was getting called twice so when i stopped that section of the map the first one would still be called*

*i have no idea how i let this slip past me for so long*
