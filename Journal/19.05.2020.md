4:30pm -7pm
Today i just finished class and started on workingon my Game I have already completed alot of pixel art so i should be ok to implement it

My goal for today is to start by creating a black rectangle and program movement this should only take about two hours



8pm - 11pm
it took three hours to complete that but i also programmed a system where if you touch one side of the screen you get teleported to the oposite side of the other side of the screen like some versions of snake



this is starting to remind me of Adventure(1979) and i think i might just recreate that game but fix a couple problems i see with the game
