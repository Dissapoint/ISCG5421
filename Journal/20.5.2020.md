4:30pm - 9:50pm:

Estimated time: 2 hours
Actual time: 4 hours

*I started working on the collison of the main player character and the map,  I was thinking of having a collsion box around the walls but i both didnt know how to do this because i couldnt find a way to have an invisable box and it would take alot more lines of code*

*I chose to have the a colour collison it isnt that great but it will work for what i want to do if i have time i will improve it, i did this by having three layers. The first layer was the player character which was black(0), the second layer is the Map which is so far only yellow(10) and the third layer checks the colour of the coridnates of the player this will tell me if it collides with the wall*

*the problems this causes is*

1.If you press multiple direction buttons it goes the wrong way and you can clip through the wall

2.you have to use strict colours e.g cant use black for walls

*i will fix these problems later on if i have time*
