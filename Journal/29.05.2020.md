5:30pm - 9:00pm

Estimated time:2 hours
Actual time: 8 hours

*I spent today working on the map and after an hour of doing this i thought "there has to be a faster way of doing this then drawing rectangles everywhere but then i remember having a discussion about my project to my uncle who mentioned something about having a image as the background* 

*This would greatly reduce both time taken and code used, however i had so many problems with this that i decided to contuine working on adding the rest of the rectangles cuz its almost done*

*The problems i had doing the image idea was*

*Map was too big/small
*Map didnt line up properly
*Map didnt work with collisons
*Map Had problems with showing sections i had not planned with a image

* i could work with this but i dont have the time to make it work*
